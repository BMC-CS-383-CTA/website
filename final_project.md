# Final Project

The final project is an opportunity for you to ask a research question and use the methods covered in this class
to collect and analyze data to begin answering your research question.
The final project is a great way to demonstrate to yourself the skills you have mastered during this class. 
The final project can be done in a group of 2 students (or more with instructor's approval).

**Senior Theses and Existing Research Projects:**
If you are completing a senior thesis, you are encouraged to incorporate this course project as part of your senior thesis/capstone but you must get approval from both your course instructor and thesis/capstone advisor.

The project is about utilizing the methods we learned in class. There are 3 main things we need. The first is a good research question. The second is collecting the data and the third is drawing conclusions from the data using different methods from class. 

**Note:** The grade on the final project is not dependent on the findings. If the findings are inconclusive or do not answer your research question, that is ok. Although many of the papers we have read present their research as a linear story, in practice, research is rarely as smooth as seems in the paper. For the scope of the final project, the goal is to 1) ask a research question, 2) collect, filter, and clean a corpus, 3) use the methods covered in the class to try answering the research question by analyzing the collected corpus.

## Final Project Components

There are four main components of your research project:

#### Research Question

<!--Quantifiable in text.-->

#### Data Collection



#### Data Exploration



#### Prediction


## Deliverables

#### [Project ideation](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yzpgxcgsqdvp) (5 points) - due Friday March 3rd
This document will begin conversations between your group and the instructor about your final projects. 
The project ideation is a 250 word proposal that will provide an overview of what you are interested in. 

Please follow the instructions in this [overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yzpgxcgsqdvp). Please copy the overleaf project and submit the a completed pdf on Gradescope. 

#### [Project Proposal](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrqkdzbxhkym) (9 points) - due Friday March 17th

The project proposal is a more formal version of the Project Ideation and should incorporate the feedback you received from your project ideation. 
You can view this as a road map that specifies how you plan to 

1. create a corpus to study by collecting, filtering and cleaning data
2. apply computational text analysis and prediction methods
3. Analyze your results. 

Please follow the instructions in this [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hrqkdzbxhkym). Please copy the overleaf project and submit the a completed pdf on Gradescope. 


#### Presentations (6 points) - due April 26thh

On Wednesday April 26th (last class) we will have 7-minute presentations where each group will provide an overview of their project. 
The mid-project presentation is an opportunity for you to share your projects with the rest of the class. You will get a chance to see all the neat work your peers are doing and also provide feedback to each other.

Please use this [powerpoint template](slides/project-presentations.pptx) and email your group's slides to Adam by 10:00pm Tuesday April 25th.

If you have not chosen a time slot for your presentation, please do so. You can find the Google Spreadsheet on Piazza (Adam will make the spreadsheet later in April). To make the transitions between time slots go smoothly, I will create one powerpoint that has all of your presentations. 

#### Final Project Report/Code/Notebook (15 points) - due May 6th

The final deliverables are due by end of day of May 6th. You will submit the following:

- 4-6 page research report
- code
- corpus

The outline with detailed instructions for the research report can be found on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ktmxfvvncbqr). The research report will be submitted on Gradescope. Please create a Google Drive folder (using your CU/BC Google account) where you will upload a) the cleaned and filtered corpus b) all code used for the project. Make sure to share the Google Drive folder with your instructor and include a link in your write up.
